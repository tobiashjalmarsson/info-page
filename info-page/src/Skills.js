                <p>So far during my development career I have had the opportunity to learn several different areas.
                    As a consultant I had the opportunity to be a part of planning the entire applications together with
                    stakeholders to determine what technologies should be used given budgetary and time constraints.
                    Here I also got to do a lot of the development from scratch regarding both backend and frontend development.
                    Later I have had the chance to work in larger teams with large code bases and learned how to collaborate with
                    others in a more efficient way than just during smaller projects for academic work. Some of the technologies
                    I have worked with can be seen to the left and more information can be found in my resum√©.</p>
